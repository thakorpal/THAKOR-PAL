 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a coupled nonlinear resistor–diode network using computational techniques in MATLAB.
The circuit consists of a linear resistor connected in series with a nonlinear diode, forming a system whose operating point cannot be determined by simple algebra.
Because the diode exhibits exponential I–V characteristics, the current flowing through the network must be computed using an iterative numerical method.
This project demonstrates how the Bisection Method can be applied to find the operating (Q-point) where the resistor current and diode current become equal.
Using MATLAB, the nonlinear equation is solved, and the variation of diode current with midpoint voltage is visualized graphically.
 Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
To understand nonlinear I–V behavior of diodes
To apply iterative numerical techniques for solving nonlinear circuits
To compute operating current using the Bisection Method
To analyze the interaction between linear resistances and nonlinear diode elements
To visualize the I–V characteristics using MATLAB plotting tools
Problem Description
The analyzed electrical network consists of:
  
 A DC source (9 V)

The resistor and diode share the same current at steady-state.
Because diode current depends exponentially on voltage, solving:
Resistor Current = Diode Current
becomes a nonlinear root-finding problem.
The MATLAB program calculates the voltage across the diode and the operating current using iterative refinement.
